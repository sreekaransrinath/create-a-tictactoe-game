MLH Local Hack Day: Build 2021 Day 2 Challenge: Create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Task Statement
Recreate the classic game - tic tac toe. If you’re new to coding, we recommend keeping it simple. If you’ve been hacking a while, consider challenging yourself more by attempting it in a new language or without googling any questions. Submit your hack on our Day 2 Devpost!

# Submission

I initially thought of using Python (as usual) to finish this, but then I wouldn't be learning anything, in which case, what's the point in even participating? 

Ended up pivoting to JS and built a fairly simple version of tic-tac-toe
